# bookbot

bookbot is a project inspired by [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

bookbot can be used to analyze text files and report on the contents.

By default, bookbot generates a simple report containing the total word countt
and individualized character counts. It's invoked with:
```
python3 main.py <path_to_book_file>
```
