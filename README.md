# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot can be used to analyze text files and report on the contents.

Calling
```
python3 main.py <path_to_book_file>
```
will generate a simple report for the text file that provides the total word count and individualized character counts.
